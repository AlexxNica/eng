#
# Makefile.targ: common targets.
#
# This Makefile defines several useful targets and rules. You can use it by
# including it from a Makefile that specifies some of the variables below.
#
# Targets defined in this Makefile:
#
#	check	Checks JavaScript files for lint and style
#		Checks bash scripts for syntax
#		Checks SMF manifests for validity against the SMF DTD
#
#	clean	Removes built files
#
#	docs	Builds restdown documentation in docs/
#
#	prepush	Depends on "check" and "test"
#
#	test	Does nothing (you should override this)
#
# For details on what these targets are supposed to do, see the Joyent
# Engineering Guide.
#
# To make use of these targets, you'll need to set some of these variables. Any
# variables left unset will simply not be used.
#
#	BASH_FILES	Bash scripts to check for syntax
#			(paths relative to top-level Makefile)
#
#	CLEANFILES	Files to remove as part of the "clean" target.  Note
#			that files generated by targets in this Makefile are
#			automatically included in CLEANFILES.  These include
#			restdown-generated HTML and JSON files.
#
#	DOC_FILES	Restdown (documentation source) files. These are
#			assumed to be contained in "docs/", but (like other
#			filenames) must contain the "docs/" prefix.
#
#	JSL_CONF_NODE	Specify JavaScriptLint configuration files
#	JSL_CONF_WEB	(paths relative to top-level Makefile)
#
#			Node.js and Web configuration files are separate
#			because you'll usually want different global variable
#			configurations.  If no file is specified, none is given
#			to jsl, which causes it to use a default configuration,
#			which probably isn't what you want.
#
#	JSL_FILES_NODE	JavaScript files to check with Node config file.
#	JSL_FILES_WEB	JavaScript files to check with Web config file.
#
#	SMF_MANIFESTS	XML files to check for validity using the SMF DTD.
#
# You can also override these variables:
#
#	BASH		Path to bash (default: bash)
#
#	JSL		Path to JavaScriptLint (default: "jsl")
#
#	JSL_FLAGS_NODE	Additional flags to pass through to JSL
#	JSL_FLAGS_WEB
#	JSL_FLAGS
#
#	JSSTYLE		Path to jsstyle (default: jsstyle)
#
#	JSSTYLE_FLAGS	Additional flags to pass through to jsstyle
#

#
# Defaults for the various tools we use.
#
BASH		?= bash
JSL		?= jsl
JSSTYLE		?= jsstyle
RESTDOWN	?= restdown
RMTREE		?= rm -rf
XMLLINT		?= xmllint --noout
JSL_FLAGS  	?= --nologo --nosummary

#
# Defaults for other fixed values.
#
SMF_DTD		?= /usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1

#
# Configure JSL_FLAGS_{NODE,WEB} based on JSL_CONF_{NODE,WEB}.
#
ifneq ($(origin JSL_CONF_NODE), undefined)
	JSL_FLAGS_NODE += --conf=$(JSL_CONF_NODE)
endif

ifneq ($(origin JSL_CONF_WEB), undefined)
	JSL_FLAGS_WEB += --conf=$(JSL_CONF_WEB)
endif

#
# Targets. For descriptions on what these are supposed to do, see the
# Joyent Engineering Guide. These targets are protected by ifneq/ifeq for the
# appropriate Make variables so that they don't do anything if the user hasn't
# specified input.
